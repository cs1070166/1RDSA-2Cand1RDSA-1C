# DSPKW-2CandDSPKW-1C
Use the runFirstOrder.m file in the folder DSPKW-2CandDSPKW-1Ccode folder to run the code and compare all the algorithms. In the folder circulantpert.m and circulantpert_1s.m files correspond to the algorithms in our paper. getOptima.m, loss_myexample.m, loss_myexample_noise.m correspond to the benchmark functions on which we run our algorithms. hadamardpert.m and hadamardpert_1s.m
use Hadamard matrix based perturbations. onespsa.m and onespsa_1s.m use random Bernoulli pertubations
